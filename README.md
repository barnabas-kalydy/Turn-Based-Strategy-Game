# Turn-Based-Strategy-Game

---
### My motivation
I love strategy games, especially turn-based strategy games. My favorites was European War 4, World
Conqueror 3, and other games developed by Easytech. When I started programming my dream was to make a 
strategy game like these. This game is my hobby and passion project where I'm making my own
turn based strategy game.

### Game Insight:
Actually this is a 2D Tile-Based game where there are teams with multiple troop types fighting
each other. Currently the red and blue rectangles indicates the teams of the specific troops.
The green line under the troops indicates the health of that troop.
